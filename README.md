# 🚗 Smart Car Rental Management System

A **full-stack Car Rental Management System** built from scratch using  
**JavaScript for the frontend** and **Python (Django + Django REST Framework)** for the backend.

This project is developed with a **real-world, production-oriented mindset**, following
proper documentation, clean architecture, and **daily incremental GitHub updates**.
